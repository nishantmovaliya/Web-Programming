            Computer engineers work with hardware and software, ensuring that the two are seamlessly integrated and functioning properly. Computer engineers focus on innovationâ€”making computing systems safer, faster and more powerfull. At the career level, there are two main avenues: hardware and software engineering. Hardware engineers focus their skills on computer systems and components, designing microprocessors, circuit boards, routers and other embedded devices. On the software side, these engineers create, test and debug programs and applications that run on computers, mobile devices and more.
