        <h2>Happy New Year 2021</h2>
        <p>On my behalf and on behalf of GEC, Modasa, I wish you a Happy and Prosperous New Year 2021.</p>
        <p>The past year has been exceptionally challenging because of the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe in general and our country in particular. 
            But with the support of Directorate of Technical Education and Education Department of Govt. of Gujarat, GECM has done well for providing 
            online education to students and won the award of Best institute in Innovative Practices and Online teaching in the function of Teachers’ 
            day on 5th September,2020 by Education department.</p>
            <p>This pandemic has open many new avenues in the field of education. 
                We were forces to introduced many changes in the teaching learning activities, assessment methods etc. 
                doing regularly. But all faculties of GECM had taken this task as a mission and contribute the best of their capacity so that the students’ 
                education would not suffer. Still many challenges are there in the online education such as, to develop new pedagogical practices (such as blended learning and flipped classrooms), 
                new student assessment tools, remote industry participation, virtual placement of students, etc. 
                I am sure that with the time progress, we would also find out some new, feasible solutions to challenges posed right now.</p>
            <p>We are grateful to all our well-wishers and alumni for providing support in the placement, training and participation in the curricular 
                and extra-curricular activities in the past year and look forward same in the years ahead.</p>
