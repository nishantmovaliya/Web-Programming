        <u><h2 style="text-align: center;">About Department</h2></u>
        <p>This department is running from 2001. The staff has developed required laboratories in the areas like Computer Hardware, Computer Networking & Security, Database Management System, Computer Graphics and Internet Technology in tune with real-time systems.

        </p>
        <p>The Internet access is provided to the students to update their knowledge in various fields. Currently, a project under AICTE Grant for Campus Networking is under process. The Computer Department is equipped with around 150 computers with multimedia software and LAN Systems with Internet connection.

        </p>
        <p>The Department has purchased Latest Computer Servers and Network-based online teaching system software named Content Server. The department is sharing all infrastructural facilities of Information Technology Department. The laboratories in the department are well developed to cater needs of the students. 
            Department is also offering Post Graduate course in Computer Science & Engineering since 2010.</p>

        <u><h2 style="text-align: center;">About Course</h2></u>
        <p>Computer engineering blends together computer science and electrical engineering to further advancements in digital 
            technology, computer networking, and computer systems. In turn, computer engineers use their extensive knowledge of 
            hardware and software design and computer programming to make computing platforms and applications more efficient and 
            effective. Seamlessly integrating the latest innovations, computer engineers develop new computer hardware, design and 
            implement software applications, and enhance the capabilities of networks and communications systems.
        </p>
        <p>Computer engineers work with hardware and software, ensuring that the two are seamlessly integrated and functioning properly. 
            Computer engineers focus on innovationâ€”making computing systems safer, faster and more powerfull. At the career level, there 
            are two main avenues: hardware and software engineering. Hardware engineers focus their skills on computer systems and 
            components, designing microprocessors, circuit boards, routers and other embedded devices. On the software side, 
            these engineers create, test and debug programs and applications that run on computers, mobile devices and more.
