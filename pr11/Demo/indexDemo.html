<p><img src="01.jpg" alt="Ahmedabad city" height="300" width="500" class="cityimg">Ahmedabad is the largest city
and former capital of the Indian state of Gujarat. It is the administrative h
eadquarters of the Ahmedabad
district and the seat of the Gujarat High Court. Ahmedabad's population of 5,
633,927 (as per 2011 population
census) makes it the fifthmost populous city in India, and the encompassing urban agglomeration population
estimated at 6,357,693 is the seventhmost populous in India. Ahmedabad is located on the banks of the
Sabarmati River, 23 km (14 mi) from the state capital Gandhinagar, which is i
ts twin city.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad has emerged as an important economic and industrial hub in India. It
is the second-largest producer
of cotton in India, and its stock exchange is the country's second oldest. Cr
icket is a popular sport in
Ahmedabad. A newly built Sardar r Patel Stadium at Motera can accommodate 110,0
00 spectators. The effects of
liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city's economy toward
s tertiary sector activities
such as commerce, communication and construction. Ahmedabad's increasing popu
lation has resulted in an
increase in the construction and housing industries resulting in recent devel
opment of skyscrapers.</p>
<p>In 2010, Ahmedabad was ranked third in Forbes's list of fastest growing cities
of the decade. In 2012, The
Times of India chose Ahmedabad as India's best city to live in. As of 2017, A
hmedabad's estimated gross
domestic product was $68 billion (PPP dollars).</p>
